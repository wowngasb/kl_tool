Sorry, guys.

23
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:26,241
Landlord is sending buyers over
today so... put your pants on.

24
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:30,601
Maybe if I don't, it'll scare 'em
off and we can stay here.

25
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:34,041
[singsong] Not an option, Ryan.
Lease is up in four weeks.

Hey, I'm thinking of you.
I've got somewhere to go.

Nate's roommate took a job in
Phoenix so I get his place.

- Okay.
- Now who's the slow poke?

You want a cookie with that?

38
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:27,825

- Sounds awesome. [giggles]

- Good to hear.

- New job, first day.

- At Blankman-Harper.

Whoa! Top floor! That's...

- I know, right? [laughs]

It's great you're still
happy at Hoddicker.

- It's OK for now.

Lacie, I got you a smoothie.

Got one for everyone, actually.
Still a bunch of them for grabs.

76
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:11,121
They're from the organic
stall at the farmers' market.

Sure. Okay.

Thank you. Thank you.

[whispers] We're kind
of not talking to Ches.

83
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:41,281
- 3.1? What happened?
- Him and Gordon split up.

Oh...

85
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:45,761
- Poor Ches.
- No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side.

86
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,521
Sure! Obviously.

87
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:52,121
Ches is kissing ass.
Trying to scrape himself back.

88

Of course, if it drops below two-five,
then it's... bye-bye.

[Lacie] Hello?

96

- [Ryan] <i>Yo, they're taking it.</i>
- Who?

97
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:35,241
<i>The couple the landlord sent over.
I heard them talking.</i>

98
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,305
Okay.

99
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:43,401
So, now we move into
the light space area.

100
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:47,361
Ideal for special times with loved ones.

101

photo stream to make her.

00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:01,681
Great hair!

105
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:04,127
[woman] Styled free of charge
at the members' salon.

106
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:07,705
Oh, my God. [giggles]

107
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:11,001
[Lacie] It's hilarious!

108
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,721
[woman] You like him?

109
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,841
- He's okay.
- He doesn't come with the apartment.

110
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:19,345
[both laugh]

111
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:24,161
But there is a bar and restaurant
on site, tenants only.

112
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:28,361
We have unparalleled
metrics on romantic geneses.

113
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:29,481
Uh-huh.

114
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:33,227
[woman] I gotta say,
these places are going like "that."

115
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:37,466
- So don't delay if you're interested.
- Oh, I'm more than interested.

116
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,346
Standard occupancy on a
minimum six-month contract,

117
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,810
we're talking... this much.

118
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,090
- How often are the payments?
- That's weekly.

119
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,506
- Okay.
- [woman laughs]

120
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,506
- A little more than expected?
- Yeah.

121
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:55,226
There's options.

122
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,706
You know our Prime Influencers Programme?

123
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,450
- Do I qualify for that?
- No. No, you don't.

124
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,650
We'd need you around a 4.5.

125
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:07,706
4.5?

126
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,890
Hit 4.5 and there's a 20% discount.

127
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,810
- 4.5.
- That's right.

128
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,850
[sighs]

129
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,866

[laughs softly]

134
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,746
Pelican Cove? What is this?
A eugenics programme?

135
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,746
- A lifestyle community.
- No one is this happy.

136
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,266
A two-year-old with a fucking
balloon isn't this happy.

137
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,227
It's actually a pretty cool place.

138
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,090
Like you'd even qualify.

139
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,306
There's nothing I can do, sir.

140
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,826
[man] Well, it's not hopeless,
you're clearly a tryer.

141
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,386
That's the sense you get just from... me?

142
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,066
From your rep report analytics.

143
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,706
If we drill down into the numbers,
you've got a solid popularity arc here.

144
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,210
Strong overall trajectory.
Let's just look at the last 24 hours.

145
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,940
You see, even...

146
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,506
What's that? 8:40 a.m. You're
working hard on your socials.

147
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,546
- Great little uptake there.
- Okay.

148
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,906
Couple of minor dings there.
You cut someone off in traffic?

149
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,826
Oh, just a workplace thing. [laughs]

150
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,866
Okay. Let's check on
your sphere of influence.

151
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,930
Let me zoom out here.

152
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:19,266
Great peripherals.
Strangers like you, that's a plus.

153
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,586
- Healthy inner circle. It's good.
- Thank you. [giggles]

154
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:27,490
There's a ways to go,
but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

155
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:29,403
How long do you think?

156
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,603
- To hit 4.5?
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,683
Well, barring a major setback,

158
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:36,867
a public disgrace kind of deal,
I'd say 18 months or so.

159
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:42,403
Oh, I need more short term.
Like... much more. [laughs]

160
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,707
Then you'll need a boost.

161
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,787
- What kind of a boost?
- Well...

162
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,083
Most of your interactions are
confined to your inner circle

163
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:55,603
and they're largely, pardon the term,
mid-to low-range folks.

164
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:57,043
Same with your outer circle.

165
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,323
You've got a ton of reciprocal five
stars from service industry workers,

166
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,283
but there's not much else.

167
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:03,626
At least as far as I can see.

168
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:06,923
So in terms of quality,
you could use a punch up right there.

169
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:10,107
Ideally, that's up votes
from quality people.

170
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,643
- Quality people?
- High fours.

171
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,283
Impress those up-scale folks,
you'll gain velocity on your arc

172
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:18,947
and there's your boost.

173
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:21,987
[phone beeps]

174
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:30,667

Would you like a croissant?

186

They gave me an extra
at the coffee place.

Oh, my God.

00:18:57,003 --> 00:19:01,163
I mean, you've got such cool
friends now. Are you sure?

254

<i>Remember when we used to plan our
dream weddings when we were, like, 11?</i>

264
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,403
<i>Not much to it. A speech, mainly.</i>

265
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,523
Speech? Of course!

266
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,283
Mm-hmm. How big's the crowd?

267
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,803
<i>Oh, my gosh, like...</i>
[sings] <i>hundreds!</i>

<i>It's a crazy guest list. I'll send it now.</i>

269
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:52,403
<i>Paul's invited so many,
I don't want to call them big deals,</i>

270

Nay-Nay, I will not
let you down. [giggles]

<i>Don't sweat too much!
Just talk about old memories.</i>

- Sure.
- <i>How we were, any old things.</i>

275
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:12,003
- Gotcha.
- <i>I'll ping you some anecdotes.</i>

276
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,243
- That would be great.
- <i>And what's your dress size?</i>

277
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,483
Oh, um...

You two pussy pals now?

292
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:47,803
[sighs] Shut up.

293
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:51,163
- She was always mean to you.
- No, she wasn't.

294
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:54,923
- She had that rhyme about you.
- That was a game.

295
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:58,363
- What about when she cut your hair?
- I asked her to.

296
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,003
She fucked Greg.

297
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:04,987
She... did not fuck Greg. [laughs]

298
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,867
She looked hot. I'll give her that.

299
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:20,094
[man] Okay.

300
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,587
Impressive.

301
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:31,043

[woman] <i>Pelican Cove.</i>

Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the
place yesterday. I wanna take it.

00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,883
<i>That's fantastic!</i>

306

<i>Uh... Oh, I see you're still
on a 4.2. Is that, um...</i>

00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:47,763
Yep, I'm on it, just gonna
transfer the deposit now.

308

- <i>Well, okay.</i>
- Yes!

309
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:55,467
In this world, we're all so
caught up in our own heads.

310
00:21:57,147 --> 00:22:02,547
It's easy to lose sight of
what's real. What matters.

311
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:07,067
But as I stand here today...

312
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:13,427
seeing the joy Paul has
brought to Naomi's life,

313
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:19,147
I know she's someone
who truly matters to me.

314
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:21,227
[laughs]

315
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,347
Nay-Nay,

316
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:29,643
the little girl who, when we were
just five-years-old in art camp,

317
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:34,867
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

318
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:42,827
The girl who helped me make
Mr. Rags. I still have him. [giggles]

319
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:46,067
He sits on my desk and...

320
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:50,787
every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay.

321
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:56,547
What she meant to me then and now.

322
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:01,747
I am so honored to be here

323
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:08,907
and I wish you all the happiness
this stupid world can muster.

324
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:13,827
I love you, Nay-Nay.

325
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,107
Is the tear too much?

326
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:21,083
- You fucking sociopath.
- [phone beeps]

327
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:26,163
- Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?
- What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?

328
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,123
I do keep him on my desk.

329
00:23:28,147 --> 00:23:31,043
There's sugary and then
there's fucking diabetes.

330
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,923
I just wanna make her
happy on her wedding day.

331
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:36,923
The captive audience of 4-point
holies five-starring your ass off,

332
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,083
that's just a bonus.

333
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:41,443
- Naomi and I were best friends.
- [laughing] Come on...

334
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:44,403
I wish her well and wanna
express it the best I can.

335
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:46,923
And, yeah, if I nail a speech
and get five-starred

336
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,403
by hundreds of primes, so what?
It's a win-win.

337
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:53,688
What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?

338
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:56,769
Unh-unh. You get points
from your gaming buddies.

339
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:59,449
It's the same thing.
Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

340
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:00,769
Pelican Cove higher?

341
00:24:00,793 --> 00:24:03,689
What's wrong with Pelican Cove?
They're great apartments!

342
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,689
- They are fake-smile jail cells.

to book another, and I took a ding.

Before this obsession, when we
had conversations, remember?

347
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:21,203
I need my charger.

348
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:25,723
This whole ranking thing, just
comparing yourself to people who...

349
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:28,963
- Have you seen my charger?
- ...only pretend to be happy.

350

I said don't borrow this!

351

- You're my sister!

356

Yes! And if you cared about that,
maybe you would've noticed

357
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:51,227
living with you hasn't been one
big rainbow sandwich for me.

358
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:54,963
Do you know why I never
brought any guys back here?

359
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:58,523
Because I didn't want them to know
I was sharing a skanky-ass cave

I'm invoking my authority
as airport security

Your charger doesn't fit my car.

511
00:35:07,387 --> 00:35:10,627
- Don't see those around much these days.
- It's a rental.

512
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:16,667
Ours chargers are Q2Z, yours one's a K1.
They didn't give you an adapter?

513
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:20,427
No. Do you have one?

514
00:35:22,382 --> 00:35:26,243
- Not in here. Ask around.
- Thanks, anyway.

515
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:28,307
You're super helpful.

516
00:35:31,387 --> 00:35:32,507
[phone beeps]

517
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:36,707
[phone beeps]

518
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:39,827
[gasps]

519
00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:42,107
Two stars?!

520
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:44,443
Two stars?

521
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,587
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

522
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:52,083
[Lacie] Sir, excuse me.

523
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:53,843
Excuse me, sorry.

524
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:57,547
Do you have a K1 adapter, by any chance?

525
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:03,267
Ma'am, how about you, a K1 adapter,
perhaps, in the trunk of your car?

526
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:05,696
Sure.

527
00:36:07,187 --> 00:36:08,267
Great.

528
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,987
Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?

529
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,307
I have a rental car. It's...

530
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:20,547
[grunting]

531
00:37:01,707 --> 00:37:06,107
- Slow down. Let's give her a ride.
- [man] She's, like, 2.8.

532
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:08,043
[phone beeps]

533
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,307
Come on!

534
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:14,427
[phone beeps]

535
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:18,147
I didn't even do anything!

536
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:40,547
You look like you need a ride.

537
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:43,403
Um...

538
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,227
Actually, I'm okay.

539
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:53,867
Don't look it. Come on. I don't bite.

540
00:37:56,747 --> 00:38:01,243
Luther, Mrs. Coffee, reds,
whiskey. Help yourself.

541
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,107
I'm okay. Thanks.

542
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,603
Where are you headed?

543
00:38:05,627 --> 00:38:10,427
Uh... Just as close as you can get
to Port Mary would be great. [laughs]

544
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:21,947
Checking my feed for danger signs?

545
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:29,027
I get it a lot. 1.4 gotta be
an antisocial maniac, right?

546
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:32,363
- You seem...
- Normal?

547
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:34,587
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

548
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:40,667
It took some effort.
What happened to you?

549
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:45,483
I mean, you're a 2.8,
but you don't look 2.8.

550
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:47,163
That's not... This is temporary.

551
00:38:47,187 --> 00:38:49,363
- I'm gonna turn it around.
- Uh-huh.

552
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:52,603
- I'm going to a wedding. Maid of honour.
- Nice.

553
00:38:52,627 --> 00:38:54,187
Wanna hear my speech?

554
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:55,987
No.

555
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:02,043
So how come you're a 2.8?

556
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:05,563
Well, I got marked down
at the airport for yelling,

557
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:08,243
and they put me on double damage.

558
00:39:08,267 --> 00:39:11,427
- How did it feel?
- Awful.

559
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:13,747
I meant the yelling.

560
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:17,667
I don't know. I was mad.

561
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:20,747
Look at where it got me.

562
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,963
But as long as I get to the
wedding, do the speech,

563
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:28,443
they'll overlook the
2.8. I'm with the bride.

564
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,523
And if I do well, well,
they're all high fours

565
00:39:30,547 --> 00:39:31,803
so that velocitates my arc.

566
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,483
And once they lift the point penalty,
well, my average goes way up,

567
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,067
and, yeah, it's gonna be okay.

568
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:43,403
God, you remind me of me.

569
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:45,867
- Hmm.
- Not now.

570
00:39:47,747 --> 00:39:51,427
I was, uh... 4.6 once.

571
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:56,227
- 4.6?
- Used to live for it.

572
00:39:57,507 --> 00:39:59,827
All the work I put in...

573
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:06,043
Eight years ago, Tom,
my husband, got cancer.

574
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:11,307
It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.
The symptoms showed up late.

575
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:13,867
I'm so sorry.

576
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,363
You don't know me so
you're not really sorry.

577
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:21,627
You're just mainly awkward cos I
have sprung some cancer talk at you.

578
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:25,243
Anyway, I five-starred every doctor,

579
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:29,883
every nurse, every high-four
consultant that we had.

580
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:31,723
Ding. Ding. Ding. Thank you so much.

581
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:34,467
The cancer didn't give a shit.
It just kept growing.

582
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:39,643
A couple of months in, we heard
about this experimental treatment.

583
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:43,347
It was very expensive.
It was very exclusive.

584
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:48,347
I did everything I could
to get him a spot there.

585
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,827
Tom was a 4.3.

586
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:57,307
They gave his bed to a 4.4.

587
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:06,467
So when he died I thought, fuck it.

588
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:10,923
I started saying what I wanted,
when I wanted.

589
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:12,427
Just drop it out there.

590
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:14,987
People don't always like that.

591
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:19,323
It is incredible how fast
you slip off the ladder

592
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:21,083
when you start doing that.

593
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:25,627
It turned out a lot of my
friends didn't care for honesty.

594
00:41:27,707 --> 00:41:32,003
Treated me like I had taken a
shit at their breakfast table.

595
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:36,083
But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

596
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:38,587
Shedding those fuckers.

597
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,347
It was like taking off tight shoes.

598
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:46,083
- Maybe you should try it?
- Oh, come on. [laughs]

599
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,443
Why not?

600
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:52,163
I can't just kick off my shoes
and walk the earth or whatever.

601
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:55,547
- You won't know unless you try.
- Oh, that's just...

602
00:41:57,907 --> 00:42:00,923
Look, you had something with your life,

603
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:06,683
real things, good things,
and you lost it all, and I'm sorry.

604
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:11,323
So now you've got nothing left to lose.

605
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:14,243
But I don't even have the
something worth losing, not yet.

606
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:17,707
You know, I mean,
I'm still fighting for that.

607
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:24,907
- And what is "that"?
- I don't know. Enough to be content?

608
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:31,267
Like, to look around and think,
well, I guess I'm okay.

609
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:36,867
Just to be able to breathe out,
not feeling like... like...

610
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:44,283
Like just... And that is
way off, like, way, way off.

611
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:47,147
And until I get there, I have
to play the numbers game.

612
00:42:47,787 --> 00:42:51,947
We all do, that's what we're in.
That's how the fucking world works.

613
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:57,987
Look, maybe you don't remember,
you know, you're just too old to get it.

614
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,067
I do not mean that how it sounds.

615
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:07,107
Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.

616
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:35,283
- Sweetheart.
- [gasps] What time is it?

617
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:39,603
I'm heading east from here so I think
you need to get yourself another ride.

618
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:42,763
- Where are we?
- About 30 miles from Port Mary.

619
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,083
A lot of buses stop here
so you should be fine.

620
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:49,403
- Well, thank you.
- Good luck with your speech.

621
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,027
[laughs]

622
00:43:51,947 --> 00:43:54,803
I put a little something in there for you.

623
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:58,383
- You did?
- Emergency escape hatch!

624
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:02,587
Bye.

625
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:20,683
[Lacie] In this world,
we're all so caught up...

626
00:44:20,707 --> 00:44:22,923
- [door opens]
- ...in our own dramas.

627
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:26,163
- [girl] So, Dad was like...
- It's easy to forget what matters.

628
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:27,762
[girl] He'd never even heard of the show.

629
00:44:27,786 --> 00:44:29,803
I'm like, "You never heard of
Sea of Tranquillity?"

630
00:44:29,827 --> 00:44:32,523
Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy,

631
00:44:32,547 --> 00:44:34,523
and he's all like,
"What the fuck?" Whatever!

632
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,763
I think I'm allergic to this purple.

633
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:40,083
So I'm like, "Well, I'm going
to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary.

634
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:42,763
That's why I'm dressed
like Lieutenant Duster."

635
00:44:42,787 --> 00:44:45,683
He's all like, "Uh...
Port Mary is frickin' miles away."

636
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:46,803
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

637
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:51,683
- [toilet flushes]
- He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.

638
00:44:51,707 --> 00:44:55,107
- [girl 1] See you back on there.
- [girl 2] Okay.

639
00:44:58,787 --> 00:45:02,763
Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?

640
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:05,803
- You're into Sea of Tranquillity?
- Totally.

641
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:07,403
I was all set to go.

642
00:45:07,427 --> 00:45:13,147
My friend, who is there already,
has my costume, but my car broke down.

643
00:45:13,827 --> 00:45:16,507
Well, there's some space in the RV.

644
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:27,523
- Hi.
- Hey!

645
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:29,683
- You're a Trank head, huh?
- Sorry?

646
00:45:29,707 --> 00:45:32,003
Trank head. Sea of Tranquillity fan?

647
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:35,643
Oh, yeah. We say Tranksters where I'm from.

648
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:39,283
- Who's your favourite character?
- Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

649
00:45:39,307 --> 00:45:41,123
- She's awesome.
- She?

650
00:45:41,147 --> 00:45:43,403
He! I misspoke.

651
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:46,163
Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.

652
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:49,763
I know, and that's why it's
so hard to remember, right?

653
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:51,803
- [ringtone playing]
- Excuse me. Gotta get this.

654
00:45:51,827 --> 00:45:54,507
My friend, at the convention. [giggles]

655
00:45:56,747 --> 00:45:58,643
Hi, Nay! [laughs]

656
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:04,003
So, oh, my God, insane night,
but I am so close now.

657
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,603
[Naomi] <i>Don't come.</i>

658
00:46:05,627 --> 00:46:09,203
What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away.

659
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:11,243
Don't come. I don't want you here.

660
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:14,843
I don't know what is up with you,
but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding.

661
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:18,203
Oh, no, that's temporary!
That's temporary.

662
00:46:18,227 --> 00:46:20,523
<i>Well, the wedding's today so...</i>

663
00:46:20,547 --> 00:46:23,083
- But it doesn't change anything.
- <i>Lacie...</i>

664
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:25,283
- I can still do the same speech.
- <i>Lacie...</i>

665
00:46:25,307 --> 00:46:28,603
- And there's Mr. Rags!
- No!

666
00:46:28,627 --> 00:46:31,283
<i>But... But you invited me.</i>

667
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:33,963
You've seen the guest list.
They are all, like, 4.5 or above.

668
00:46:33,987 --> 00:46:37,403
They are going to freak at a 2.6,
and I am not taking that kind of damage,

669
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,067
plus I haven't dipped under
a 4.7 in, like, six months.

670
00:46:41,627 --> 00:46:45,123
You said you wanted your oldest friend.

671
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:48,283
<i>When I asked you to speak,
you were a 4.2, okay?</i>

672
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:51,683
And the authenticity of a vintage bond
low four at a gathering of this calibre

673
00:46:51,707 --> 00:46:54,723
played fantastically on all
the stimulations we ran.

674
00:46:54,747 --> 00:46:57,003
Forecast was a prestige
bounce of 2 minimum.

675
00:46:57,027 --> 00:47:00,603
But now you're a sub three. Sorry.

676
00:47:00,627 --> 00:47:02,323
That just puts the stink on
things a little too much.

677
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:04,523
That just plays badly for us.

678
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:07,003
So it was just about numbers for you?

679
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:10,163
Oh, cut the shit! It was
numbers for both of us.

680
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:12,123
<i>You wanted those
primo votes, don't deny it.</i>

681
00:47:12,147 --> 00:47:15,203
<i>It's not like you could get them on
your own. Let's not kid ourselves.</i>

682
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:17,643
Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.

683
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:21,003
What? You're just gonna roll up
here and make people like you?

684
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:25,683
- That's right. I'm doing my speech.
- No, you're not.

685
00:47:25,707 --> 00:47:30,123
Yes, I am. And they are gonna vote me
through the roof when they hear it.

686
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:35,203
- Weep their fucking eyes out!
- Go home!

687
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,243
- [phone beeping]
- Hello?

688
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:40,827
[sighs] Fuck!

689
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:46,667
I have never seen
your stupid fucking show.

690
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:48,427
[tyres screech]

691
00:47:52,427 --> 00:47:55,067
[shouts] Hope they cancel it!

692
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:08,667
- [horn honks]
- I need a ride!

693
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,243
[shouts]

694
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:13,907
- [phone beeping]
- Fuck!

695
00:48:17,547 --> 00:48:19,027
Jesus!

696
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:24,307
[engine roars]

697
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:37,107
Hey! Hey!

698
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,747
Hey!

699
00:48:40,707 --> 00:48:43,163
- Can I borrow your bike?
- What?

700
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:46,363
Can I borrow your bike?

701
00:48:46,387 --> 00:48:51,363
Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,
take this man to be your husband,

702
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:54,307
to live together with him
in the covenant of marriage?

703
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:57,323
To love him, comfort him,

704
00:48:57,347 --> 00:49:01,003
honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health...

705
00:49:01,027 --> 00:49:04,427
and forsaking all others,
be faithful unto him...

706
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:16,387
[cheering and applause]

707
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:33,587
[indistinct radio chatter]

708
00:49:38,347 --> 00:49:39,587
[revs engine]

709
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:47,987
[screams]

710
00:50:06,947 --> 00:50:09,203
[applause]

711
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:12,323
To my best mate, Anthony.
Let's hear it for him.

712
00:50:12,347 --> 00:50:13,923
[cheering]

713
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:17,403
You've been there from day one.
I love you, man. I appreciate you.

714
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:20,963
Hilarious speech, by the way.
By your standards.

715
00:50:20,987 --> 00:50:22,283
[laughter]

716
00:50:22,307 --> 00:50:25,203
- Pow! Pow! Pow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughs]

717
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:28,883
[Paul] He's still got a few
bullets left. Oh, man.

718
00:50:28,907 --> 00:50:30,947
Oh, gosh, well, um...

719
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:35,107
[gasps] Shit!

720
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:39,643
[Paul] We have so many people to
thank. Our beautiful bridesmaids.

721
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,523
- [cheering]
- But, of course,

722
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:46,603
my most heartfelt thanks,
my warmest thanks,

723
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,907
are to someone who's my best friend,

724
00:50:51,187 --> 00:50:58,083
my lover and now,
I'm honoured to say, my wife.

725
00:50:58,107 --> 00:51:00,627
- Naomi!
- [cheering and whooping]

726
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:07,947
- [cheering]
- [Paul] One, two, three! Naomi!

727
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:12,283
- [man] The A Team!
- [phone beeps]

728
00:51:12,307 --> 00:51:13,723
I love you so much, darl.

729
00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:15,323
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

730
00:51:15,347 --> 00:51:17,363
[man] Congratulations, sir.

731
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:19,243
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

732
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:21,403
- [whooping]
- Get over here!

733
00:51:21,427 --> 00:51:23,003
Get your ass over here.

734
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:25,683
- Get in here, big boy.
- [phones beep]

735
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,747
- You're beautiful!
- [cheering]

736
00:51:29,707 --> 00:51:32,683
Yeah! Gimme five! Good choice!

737
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:35,107
You fucking earned it, man.
You fucking earned it.

738
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:37,867
[giggles nervously]

739
00:51:39,507 --> 00:51:41,323
Everybody, hello!

740
00:51:41,347 --> 00:51:43,387
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

741
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:51,187
Can everyone be quiet for a moment?

742
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:54,907
Thank you. [giggles]

743
00:51:56,267 --> 00:51:58,443
- Get rid of her.
- That would play awful.

744
00:51:58,467 --> 00:51:59,763
She's a fucking 1.1.

745
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:05,203
Now for those of you who don't
know me, which is... all of you...

746
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:09,243
my name is Lacie Pound

747
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:13,107
and, believe it or not,
I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

748
00:52:13,707 --> 00:52:15,827
Hi, Nay-Nay!

749
00:52:17,107 --> 00:52:20,203
It's great to meet you too, Paul.
I've heard a lot about you.

750
00:52:20,227 --> 00:52:22,083
He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

751
00:52:22,107 --> 00:52:24,563
- Pretty big deal.
- [camera shutter clicks]

752
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:28,283
He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.

753
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:30,307
[laughs] Uh...

754
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:34,787
Anyway, um... I...

755
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:40,923
have looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life.

756
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:42,883
We met when we were five years old,

757
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:47,067
and right up through to our teenage
years, we made quite the pair.

758
00:52:47,787 --> 00:52:50,083
We'd talk about all the
things girls talk about,

759
00:52:50,107 --> 00:52:56,443
you know, boys, hair, products,
uh... more boys. [laughs]

760
00:52:56,467 --> 00:53:00,083
I mean, I tried sometimes
to expand our range a little

761
00:53:00,107 --> 00:53:04,787
and talk about climate change,
but she found that kind of boring so...

762
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:06,843
Go on.

763
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:09,763
She was probably right.
I mean, fuck the planet, right?

764
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,363
Whoo!

765
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:15,883
Yes, thank you! Come on.
Let's have a little fun here.

766
00:53:15,907 --> 00:53:18,483
You know, fuck the planet! [laughs]

767
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:20,963
- [shouts] Fuck the planet!
- [feedback]

768
00:53:20,987 --> 00:53:22,467
[crockery rattles]

769
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,747
- [phone beeps]
- Anyway...

770
00:53:26,827 --> 00:53:33,843
I... looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life,

771
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:39,147
which meant she was looking down on me.

772
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:43,043
Always with a smile though. [laughs]

773
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:47,683
In high school,
she was my shoulder to cry on.

774
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:53,043
She seemed to enjoy that.
Guys and me never worked out.

775
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:57,627
They'd see Naomi and just... Whoo!
You know, that was it.

776
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:04,403
She had this tight ass,

777
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:07,603
like two fists.

778
00:54:07,627 --> 00:54:09,363
Uh-huh.

779
00:54:09,387 --> 00:54:12,483
[giggles] I was all like...

780
00:54:12,507 --> 00:54:14,627
[giggles]

781
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:18,603
I was like...

782
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:20,467
through the hallways in high school.

783
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:24,027
[cackling]

784
00:54:25,707 --> 00:54:27,307
[phones beep]

785
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,707
[cries]

786
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:40,587
And she was there for me.

787
00:54:43,027 --> 00:54:44,467
Holding my hair back...

788
00:54:46,107 --> 00:54:51,347
as I knelt, vomiting,
in front of the crapper.

789
00:54:55,947 --> 00:54:59,427
Thank you for that, Naomi.

790
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,347
I always wished I was you.

791
00:55:06,627 --> 00:55:07,907
And...

792
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:11,227
I guess that's why you
kept me around so long?

793
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:17,443
Until you got your new job

794
00:55:17,467 --> 00:55:22,427
and your fancy new friends.

795
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,803
And that...

796
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:28,683
[laughs]

797
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:31,827
...fucking... jackhole!

798
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:36,163
And you didn't need me.
You probably got another me.

799
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:41,603
Guess there's some other "yeth Beth"
you moved on to like a succubus.

800
00:55:41,627 --> 00:55:44,387
- [phones beeping]
- I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!

801
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:48,147
- [crowd gasps]
- Stay back.

802
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:52,683
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

803
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:54,603
I'll cut his head off
and stick it up my ass!

804
00:55:54,627 --> 00:55:55,867
[gasps]

805
00:55:56,947 --> 00:55:59,443
[gasps] Time's nearly up!

806
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:00,643
- Hey! Calm down.
- I...

807
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:05,723
I just wanted to say, in this
world so caught up in our own shit,

808
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:09,147
- let's not forget what matters.
- It's okay. It's okay.

809
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:15,707
Happiness, fucking Paul
and Naomi, and she's...

810
00:56:16,187 --> 00:56:20,307
She... She fucked Greg!

811
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:23,827
I know she did.

812
00:56:24,907 --> 00:56:27,843
- I know you did.
- No...

813
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:30,203
Don't even try to deny...

814
00:56:30,227 --> 00:56:32,603
- [screams]
- [feedback screeches]

815
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:38,043
The little girl who, when we
were just five-years-old in art camp,

816
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:41,747
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared

817
00:56:42,427 --> 00:56:44,923
and helped me make Mr. Rags.

818
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:50,523
He reminds me of you and
what you meant to me then!

819
00:56:50,547 --> 00:56:54,107
[cries] And I'm so honoured
to be here to see this shit!

820
00:56:55,027 --> 00:57:00,227
[screams] I love you, Nay-Nay!
I've always loved you!

821
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,587
I love you!

822
00:57:04,827 --> 00:57:05,907
[camera shutter clicking]

823
00:57:21,067 --> 00:57:23,387
[whirring]

824
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,227
[breathes deeply]

825
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:16,763
[sobs]

826
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:18,187
[laughs]

827
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:50,643
What the fuck are you looking at?

828
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,707
Just what I was wondering.

829
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:53,749
Well...

830
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:56,612
Don't!

831
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,643
Don't? Don't wonder?

832
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:01,827
Uh-huh.

833
01:00:02,427 --> 01:00:04,752
It would be a dull
world without wonder.

834
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:07,571
I don't give a shit about your world.

835
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:10,307
I don't like your brassiere.

836
01:00:13,707 --> 01:00:15,187
I don't like your moustache.

837
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:18,443
I don't like your aura.

838
01:00:18,467 --> 01:00:20,707
- My aura?
- Yeah.

839
01:00:22,427 --> 01:00:26,283
I don't like your... head.

840
01:00:26,307 --> 01:00:29,043
Your entire head is
just ridiculous to me.

841
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:30,283
Really?

842
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:36,163
You look like an alcoholic
former weatherman.

843
01:00:36,187 --> 01:00:38,723
You sound like a lost little lamb

844
01:00:38,747 --> 01:00:41,227
that just got told there's no Santa Claus.

845
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:45,243
What sort of cartoon character
did your mum have to fuck

846
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,923
to brew you up in the womb?

847
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:48,683
At least I look like I was born,

848
01:00:48,707 --> 01:00:53,243
not shit out by some tormented cow
creature in an underground lab.

849
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:55,003
You got tossed out of that lab.

850
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,563
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, flushed out.

851
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,483
- Ooh!
- In the trash!

852
01:01:00,507 --> 01:01:04,123
- Your face is a fucking...
- Fucking.

853
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:08,083
Fucking biological car crash

854
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:10,163
that made Picasso screw
his eyes up and say,

855
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:11,723
"Well, that just don't make sense."

856
01:01:11,747 --> 01:01:13,523
[laughs]

857
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:16,203
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Fuck you!

858
01:01:16,227 --> 01:01:19,049
- Fuck you next Wednesday.
- Fuck you for Christmas!

859
01:01:19,074 --> 01:01:23,914
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
