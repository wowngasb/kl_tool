00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:17,198
The war ended, bahubali and bhlal dev
showed politeness and mercy.

3
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:22,096
But like bahubali defended his people.

4
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:27,129
By his impression, the queen
declared him the king..

5
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:33,196
The people were happy,
and queen was awaifi'ng for him.

6
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:38,296
Then the beast comes up,
who comes once In 26 years..

7
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:45,230
lt's the royal rules that the bride
of royal family goes to her test.

8
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:54,166
She's to go to temple bear foot
toward the beast holding _re

9
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:58,161
fi'll the trouble goes away,
the feet shouldn't be stopped.

10
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:53,003
The queen..

11
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:12,007
Did you ever feel that you
should kill your mother.

12
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:22,038
l felt, the lap you should get It.

13
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:26,069
After his birth, your mother
gave him a half..

14
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:30,103
Then l feltto kill him

15
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,836
the seprafi'on In gold, kingdom,
and all the rights.

16
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:41,038
When she was giving him half
of evemhing, so l felt to kill her.

17
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:50,841
When he's giving the kingdom,
so l'm feeling to wreck his neck.

18
00:13:55,033 --> 00:14:00,071
Do we kill him

19
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:11,837
lt's not your madhirapur.

20
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,804
Whats up you dog..
What to bark?

21
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:48,003
The bahuballi Is going
to get the kingdom..

22
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:51,802
Queen wanted you to know that..

23
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,971
lt happened that day,
my kingdom nominated to my brother.

24
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,838
And today my son's kingdom
Is going to nominated to his son.

25
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,838
Will my generafi'on stay
like a slave?

26
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,969
Why he's not nominated king.?

27
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:33,873
l'm disable so?
l've iron hand..

28
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,837
The reason Is not your disabality

29
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,900
your disable brain.

30
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,937
You dog, one who insult royals
will be executed.

31
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,702
Pardon me, think about killing
your wife..

32
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:20,706
You heared It..
No l'm dog, l smelled It.

33
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,735
She's the princess varohi.

34
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:49,802
lt Is said, there's no beaufi'ful
woman like her In enfi're india.

35
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,870
She hasn't shine In her eyes.
She don't deserve bahubali.

36
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,900
Find someone else.

37
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:10,741
Remember one thing, the girl will not
be only bahubali's wife but queen too

38
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,603
there shouldn't be any reason
to point her out

39
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:21,637
you called me..
Yes, you should go now for mission

40
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:27,871
this fi'me Is not good for that..

41
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:33,704
Why demi god's idol Is roaming In temple?

42
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,669
So the demi god can see
the problem of people.

43
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:46,872
When the future king goes out,
so he _nds out the problem of poeple.

44
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,838
That old man ate my brain
telling me stories.

can you forgive my anger?

213
01:13:41,307 --> 01:13:46,178
The anger on daughter-ln-law
of shivgami looks good.

214
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,309
Stand by your future husband..

215
01:13:55,206 --> 01:13:59,244
My decision Is right or wrong,
maheswafi' will see It.

216
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,209
l've promised bhallal to mary devsena.

217
01:15:07,273 --> 01:15:10,209
Who're you to arrange my marriage
with someone with my permission

218
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:14,276
an adult girl has right to choose
his husband..

219
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:16,308
Don't you have brain?

220
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,208
How dare you talk to me like this

221
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,308
make this angy girl like slave on knees.

222
01:15:40,173 --> 01:15:44,277
lf anyone touch devsena..
So think you touch bahubali's sword.

223
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,042
l've promised to protect devsena.

224
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:07,279
You're going against the queen.

225
01:16:10,206 --> 01:16:12,242
For the promise, and for truth and jusfi'ce.

226
01:16:15,073 --> 01:16:18,042
lfyou've to go against anybody
even the demi god..

227
01:16:20,173 --> 01:16:22,241
lt's a true religion.

228
01:16:26,107 --> 01:16:29,076
lt's wrong to promise your son
without knowing girl's decision.

229
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:34,174
You made mistake.

230
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:52,013
Shivgami made mistake?
You swallowed your mother when born.

231
01:16:52,173 --> 01:16:55,175
She grew up like her own son.

232
01:16:57,006 --> 01:16:59,008
To annouce you prince?
Is that her mistake?

233
01:17:40,006 --> 01:17:44,010
You want the kingdom..

234
01:17:45,973 --> 01:17:47,941
Or that devsena?

235
01:17:49,973 --> 01:17:54,010
For the kingdom, l break my promise,
It's insult ofyour educafi'on.

236
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,810
The child of devgami..
Who's known as bhallaldev

237
01:21:28,807 --> 01:21:33,978
l'll protect this kingdom..

238
01:21:34,907 --> 01:21:39,678

01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,842
Bahubali means me..

241
01:23:00,706 --> 01:23:04,877
The protector of kingdom and princess.

242
01:23:05,907 --> 01:23:09,710
And the member of battalion
of bhalaldev

243
01:23:10,673 --> 01:23:14,676
lf l may lose my life while
protecfi'ng...

244
01:23:14,873 --> 01:23:16,741

You've come to me,
why're you running away from me.

250
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:48,578
l loved you, and you refused me
and embraced bahubali

251
01:26:33,572 --> 01:26:37,742
the sun raise on or not,
l'll set It down on west.

252
01:26:39,772 --> 01:26:42,508

Do you know what'd happened?
What'd happened devsena?

294
01:36:01,206 --> 01:36:03,942
Shiva called all the woman a side..

He was tying to rape me..

296
01:36:10,206 --> 01:36:12,975

01:42:16,706 --> 01:42:19,708
Someone Is playing game there,

305
01:43:38,772 --> 01:43:40,707
What're you doing here alone?

306

You want to kill him?

lf he thinks about something,
he'll do It done

316
01:44:38,572 --> 01:44:40,640
we should tell this to bahubali

317
01:44:47,605 --> 01:44:49,541
he won't believe that his
brother Is so mean.

318
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:54,474
There's only a way..
What?

319
01:44:56,472 --> 01:44:59,508

l don't understand whats happening.

323
01:46:59,605 --> 01:47:04,310
The great order for kill bahubali
by the shivgami's hand.

324
01:47:06,539 --> 01:47:10,476
You're a small challenge.

325
01:47:24,439 --> 01:47:30,378
Kumar and his people killed our
body guards

326
01:47:31,272 --> 01:47:33,307
and injured the king too

327
01:47:38,305 --> 01:47:40,474
after all this, now what're you thinking?

328
01:47:47,506 --> 01:47:51,476
What're you thinking shivgami,

329
01:48:03,406 --> 01:48:07,476
Bhallaldev Is not your son only,
but the king ofthis county

330
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:13,277
whoever tries to kill king..
He should be punished to death.

331
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:37,640
Your ancesstors took oath that
they'll be always servant of kingdom

332
01:49:38,604 --> 01:49:41,673
and they'll follow the orders of king.

333
01:49:43,604 --> 01:49:45,639

334
01:49:46,537 --> 01:49:47,572
Yes..
Order me.

335
01:49:51,504 --> 01:49:52,605

For his death.

404
02:22:11,298 --> 02:22:15,335

For so long your ancesstors
were loyal to kingdom..

409
02:25:13,298 --> 02:25:19,270
By destroying kingdom do you
want to break your promise

Go kattappa, kill him

413
02:25:56,198 --> 02:26:01,136
25 years ago, queen declared
bahubali our king.

414
02:26:03,065 --> 02:26:07,102
Believing him dead,
l hided the truth.

415
02:26:09,098 --> 02:26:11,066
Today our truth has come back.

416
02:26:12,264 --> 02:26:14,200
Kattappa never breaks promise.

417
02:28:03,931 --> 02:28:09,202
Before you _nish the third round, l'll
keep ready creamafi'on to burn him alive.

418
02:28:13,931 --> 02:28:16,967
Till you will come back,
l'll keep your son's head on your hand.

419
02:31:45,204 --> 02:31:48,041
Whoever completed It.
Can't be succesful

420
02:31:48,238 --> 02:31:52,208
stop It... devsena's
foot should be stopped.

421
02:31:58,171 --> 02:32:03,009
Before complefi'ng temple stairs,
burn It down.

422
02:34:55,860 --> 02:34:58,762
